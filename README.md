## A solution to disentangling crowd funding from fraud funding using Blockchain technology.

#### Description

- Fraud in the reward-based crowdfunding market has been of concern to regulators, but it is arguably of greater importance to the nascent industry itself.
- Crowdfunding has disrupted the way of financing and allowed the startups to raise funds without much hustle and bureaucracy.
- Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger, more efficient, safe, and tamper-proof system of nodes in connection.
- The introduction of blockchain in crowdfunding will make it more reliable, transparent, trusted, decentralized, cost-efficient and convenient.
- So, in order to give a solution to fraud funding using Blockchain technology, any contributor can contribute funds to a campaign, and whenever a respective campaign manager wants to spend all the funds with an appropriate vendor he/she has to make a spending request with all the contributors for transferring the funds to respective vendors. If any contributor declines the spending request then the fund will not proceed with further action.
